To address this weakness, we propose a new model, MixHop, that can learn these relationships, including difference operators, by repeatedly mixing feature representations of neighbors at various distances. MixHop requires no additional memory or computational complexity, and outperforms on challenging baselines. In addition, we propose sparsity regularization that allows us to visualize how the network prioritizes neighborhood information across different graph datasets. Our analysis of the learned architectures reveals that neighborhood mixing varies per datasets.},

   abstract = {Many biological processes are mediated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Because protein domains are the building blocks of proteins, PPIs likely rely on domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Several attempts exist to infer DDIs from PPI networks but the produced datasets are heterogeneous and sometimes not accessible, while the PPI interactome data keeps growing. We describe a new computational approach called "PPIDM" (Protein-Protein Interactions Domain Miner) for inferring DDIs using multiple sources of PPIs. The approach is an extension of our previously described "CODAC" (Computational Discovery of Direct Associations using Common neighbors) method for inferring new edges in a tripartite graph. The PPIDM method has been applied to seven widely used PPI resources, using as "Gold-Standard" a set of DDIs extracted from 3D structural databases. Overall, PPIDM has produced a dataset of 84,552 non-redundant DDIs. Statistical significance (p-value) is calculated for each source of PPI and used to classify the PPIDM DDIs in Gold (9,175 DDIs), Silver (24,934 DDIs) and Bronze (50,443 DDIs) categories. Dataset comparison reveals that PPIDM has inferred from the 2017 releases of PPI sources about 46% of the DDIs present in the 2020 release of the 3did database, not counting the DDIs present in the Gold-Standard. The PPIDM dataset contains 10,229 DDIs that are consistent with more than 13,300 PPIs extracted from the IMEx database, and nearly 23,300 DDIs (27.5%) that are consistent with more than 214,000 human PPIs extracted from the STRING database. Examples of newly inferred DDIs covering more than 10 PPIs in the IMEx database are provided. Further exploitation of the PPIDM DDI reservoir includes the inventory of possible partners of a protein of interest and characterization of protein interactions at the domain level in combination with other methods. The result is publicly available at http://ppidm.loria.fr/.},

Negatome is derived by manual curation of literature and by analyzing three-dimensional structures of protein complexes. The main methodological innovation in Negatome 2.0 is the utilization of an advanced text mining procedure to guide the manual annotation process. Potential non-interactions were identified by a modified version of Excerbt, a text mining tool based on semantic sentence analysis. Manual verification shows that nearly a half of the text mining results with the highest confidence values correspond to NIP pairs.

Despite the importance suggested by many proteins variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms, for example, protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In this study, we address this challenge using a recent machine learning advance-deep neural networks (DNNs). We aim at improving the performance of PPIs prediction and propose a method called DeepPPI (Deep neural networks for Protein-Protein Interactions prediction), which employs deep neural networks to learn effectively the representations of proteins from common protein descriptors. The experimental results indicate that DeepPPI achieves superior performance on the test data set with an Accuracy of 92.50%, Precision of 94.38%, Recall of 90.56%, Specificity of 94.49%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 85.08% and Area Under the Curve of 97.43%, respectively. Extensive experiments show that DeepPPI can learn useful features of proteins pairs by a layer-wise abstraction, and thus achieves better prediction performance than existing methods.

   abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) perform various functions and regulate processes throughout cells. Knowledge of the full network of PPIs is vital to biomedical research, but most of the PPIs are still unknown. As it is infeasible to discover all of them experimentally due to technical and resource limitations, computational prediction of PPIs is essential and accurately assessing the performance of algorithms is required before further application or translation. However, many published methods compose their evaluation datasets incorrectly, using a higher proportion of positive class data than occuring naturally, leading to exaggerated performance. We re-implemented various published algorithms and evaluated them on datasets with realistic data compositions and found that their performance is overstated in original publications; with several methods outperformed by our control models built on 'illogical' and random number features. We conclude that these methods are influenced by an over-characterization of some proteins in the literature and due to scale-free nature of PPI network and that they fail when tested on all possible protein pairs. Additionally, we found that sequence-only-based algorithms performed worse than those that employ functional and expression features. We present a benchmark evaluation of many published algorithms for PPI prediction. The source code of our implementations and the benchmark datasets created here are made available in open source.},

Three major problems arise: the lack of known PPIs for that virus to learn from, the cost of learning about its proteins and the sequence dissimilarity among viral families that makes most methods inapplicable or inefficient. We develop DeNovo, a sequence-based negative sampling and machine learning framework that learns from PPIs of different viruses to predict for a novel one, exploiting the shared host proteins. We tested DeNovo on PPIs from different domains to assess generalization.Results: By solving the challenge of generating less noisy negative interactions, DeNovo achieved accuracy up to 81 and 86% when predicting PPIs of viral proteins that have no and distant sequence similarity to the ones used for training, receptively. This result is comparable to the best achieved in single virus-host and intra-species PPI prediction cases. Thus, we can now predict PPIs for virtually any virus infecting human. DeNovo generalizes well; it achieved near optimal accuracy when tested on bacteria–human interactions.Availability and implementation: Code, data and additional supplementary materials needed to reproduce this study are available at: https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~alzahraa/denovo.Contact:alzahraa@vt.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Representation learning provides new and powerful graph analytical approaches and tools for the highly valued data science challenge of mining knowledge graphs. Since previous graph analytical methods have mostly focused on homogeneous graphs, an important current challenge is extending this methodology for richly heterogeneous graphs and knowledge domains. The biomedical sciences are such a domain, reflecting the complexity of biology, with entities such as genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, and phenotypes, and relationships such as gene co-expression, biochemical regulation, and biomolecular inhibition or activation. Therefore, the semantics of edges and nodes are critical for representation learning and knowledge discovery in real world biomedical problems. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose the edge2vec model, which represents graphs considering edge semantics. An edge-type transition matrix is trained by an Expectation-Maximization approach, and a stochastic gradient descent model is employed to learn node embedding on a heterogeneous graph via the trained transition matrix. edge2vec is validated on three biomedical domain tasks: biomedical entity classification, compound-gene bioactivity prediction, and biomedical information retrieval. Results show that by considering edge-types into node embedding learning in heterogeneous graphs, edge2vec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on all three tasks. CONCLUSIONS: We propose this method for its added value relative to existing graph analytical methodology, and in the real world context of biomedical knowledge discovery applicability.},

   abstract = {Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

Computational prediction of PPIs can be used to discover new PPIs and identify errors in the experimental PPI data.

Our model efficiently applies a deep, Siamese-like convolutional neural network combined with random projection and data augmentation to predict PPIs, leveraging existing high-quality experimental PPI data and evolutionary information of a protein pair under prediction. Our experimental results show that DPPI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks in terms of area under precision-recall curve (auPR), and computationally is more efficient. We also show that DPPI is able to predict homodimeric interactions where other methods fail to work accurately, and the effectiveness of DPPI in specific applications such as predicting cytokine-receptor binding affinities.

   abstract = {Molecular interaction networks are powerful resources for molecular discovery. They are increasingly used with machine learning methods to predict biologically meaningful interactions. While deep learning on graphs has dramatically advanced the prediction prowess, current graph neural network (GNN) methods are mainly optimized for prediction on the basis of direct similarity between interacting nodes. In biological networks, however, similarity between nodes that do not directly interact has proved incredibly useful in the last decade across a variety of interaction networks. Here, we present SkipGNN, a graph neural network approach for the prediction of molecular interactions. SkipGNN predicts molecular interactions by not only aggregating information from direct interactions but also from second-order interactions, which we call skip similarity. In contrast to existing GNNs, SkipGNN receives neural messages from two-hop neighbors as well as immediate neighbors in the interaction network and non-linearly transforms the messages to obtain useful information for prediction. To inject skip similarity into a GNN, we construct a modified version of the original network, called the skip graph. We then develop an iterative fusion scheme that optimizes a GNN using both the skip graph and the original graph. Experiments on four interaction networks, including drug-drug, drug-target, protein-protein, and gene-disease interactions, show that SkipGNN achieves superior and robust performance. Furthermore, we show that unlike popular GNNs, SkipGNN learns biologically meaningful embeddings and performs especially well on noisy, incomplete interaction networks.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are of great importance in cellular systems of organisms, since they are the basis of cellular structure and function and many essential cellular processes are related to that. Most proteins perform their functions by interacting with other proteins, so predicting PPIs accurately is crucial for understanding cell physiology. RESULTS: Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been proposed to capture the graph structure information and generate representations for nodes in the graph. In our paper, we use GCNs to learn the position information of proteins in the PPIs networks graph, which can reflect the properties of proteins to some extent. Combining amino acid sequence information and position information makes a stronger representation for protein, which improves the accuracy of PPIs prediction. CONCLUSION: In previous research methods, most of them only used protein amino acid sequence as input information to make predictions, without considering the structural information of PPIs networks graph. We first time combine amino acid sequence information and position information to make representations for proteins. The experimental results indicate that our method has strong competitiveness compared with several sequence-based methods.},

   abstract = {Dealing with relational data always required significant computational resources, domain expertise and task-dependent feature engineering to incorporate structural information into a predictive model. Nowadays, a family of automated graph feature engineering techniques has been proposed in different streams of literature. So-called graph embeddings provide a powerful tool to construct vectorized feature spaces for graphs and their components, such as nodes, edges and subgraphs under preserving inner graph properties. Using the constructed feature spaces, many machine learning problems on graphs can be solved via standard frameworks suitable for vectorized feature representation. Our survey aims to describe the core concepts of graph embeddings and provide several taxonomies for their description. First, we start with the methodological approach and extract three types of graph embedding models based on matrix factorization, random-walks and deep learning approaches. Next, we describe how different types of networks impact the ability of models to incorporate structural and attributed data into a unified embedding. Going further, we perform a thorough evaluation of graph embedding applications to machine learning problems on graphs, among which are node classification, link prediction, clustering, visualization, compression, and a family of the whole graph embedding algorithms suitable for graph classification, similarity and alignment problems. Finally, we overview the existing applications of graph embeddings to computer science domains, formulate open problems and provide experiment results, explaining how different networks properties result in graph embeddings quality in the four classic machine learning problems on graphs, such as node classification, link prediction, clustering and graph visualization. As a result, our survey covers a new rapidly growing field of network feature engineering, presents an in-depth analysis of models based on network types, and overviews a wide range of applications to machine learning problems on graphs.},

   abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important for the study of protein functions and pathways involved in different biological processes, as well as for understanding the cause and progression of diseases. Several high-throughput experimental techniques have been employed for the identification of PPIs in a few model organisms, but still, there is a huge gap in identifying all possible binary PPIs in an organism. Therefore, PPI prediction using machine-learning algorithms has been used in conjunction with experimental methods for discovery of novel protein interactions. The two most popular supervised machine-learning techniques used in the prediction of PPIs are support vector machines and random forest classifiers. Bayesian-probabilistic inference has also been used but mainly for the scoring of high-throughput PPI dataset confidence measures. Recently, deep-learning algorithms have been used for sequence-based prediction of PPIs. Several clustering methods such as hierarchical and k-means are useful as unsupervised machine-learning algorithms for the prediction of interacting protein pairs without explicit data labelling. In summary, machine-learning techniques have been widely used for the prediction of PPIs thus allowing experimental researchers to study cellular PPI networks.},

   abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for most biological processes. However, current PPI networks present high levels of noise, sparseness and incompleteness, which limits our ability to understand the cell at the system level from the PPI network. Predicting novel (missing) links in noisy PPI networks is an essential computational method for automatically expanding the human interactome and for identifying biologically legitimate but undetected interactions for experimental determination of PPIs, which is both expensive and time-consuming. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCN) have shown their effectiveness in modeling graph-structured data, which employ a 1-hop neighborhood aggregation procedure and have emerged as a powerful architecture for node or graph representations. In this paper, we propose a novel node (protein) embedding method by combining GCN and PageRank as the latter can significantly improve the GCN's aggregation scheme, which has difficulty in extending and exploring topological information of networks across higher-order neighborhoods of each node. Building on this novel node embedding model, we develop a higher-order GCN variational auto-encoder (HO-VGAE) architecture, which can learn a joint node representation of higher-order local and global PPI network topology for novel protein interaction prediction. It is worth noting that our method is based exclusively on network topology, with no protein attributes or extra biological features used. Extensive computational validations on PPI prediction task demonstrate our method without leveraging any additional biological information shows competitive performance-outperforms all existing graph embedding-based link prediction methods in both accuracy and robustness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to many biological processes. Considering that the experimental methods for identifying PPIs are time-consuming and expensive, it is important to develop automated computational methods to better predict PPIs. Various machine learning methods have been proposed, including a deep learning technique which is sequence-based that has achieved promising results. However, it only focuses on sequence information while ignoring the structural information of PPI networks. Structural information of PPI networks such as their degree, position, and neighboring nodes in a graph has been proved to be informative in PPI prediction. RESULTS: Facing the challenge of representing graph information, we introduce an improved graph representation learning method. Our model can study PPI prediction based on both sequence information and graph structure. Moreover, our study takes advantage of a representation learning model and employs a graph-based deep learning method for PPI prediction, which shows superiority over existing sequence-based methods. Statistically, Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.15% on Human protein reference database (HPRD) dataset and also obtains best results on Database of Interacting Protein (DIP) Human, Drosophila, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegan) datasets. CONCLUSION: Here, we introduce signed variational graph auto-encoder (S-VGAE), an improved graph representation learning method, to automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing sequence-based methods on several datasets. We also prove the robustness of our model for very sparse networks and the generalization for a new dataset that consists of four datasets: HPRD, E.coli, C.elegan, and Drosophila.},

Given that the experimental determination of human-virus PPIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computational methods are playing an important role in providing testable hypotheses, complementing the determination of large-scale interactome between species. In this work, we applied an unsupervised sequence embedding technique (doc2vec) to represent protein sequences as rich feature vectors of low dimensionality. Training a Random Forest (RF) classifier through a training dataset that covers known PPIs between human and all viruses, we obtained excellent predictive accuracy outperforming various combinations of machine learning algorithms and commonly-used sequence encoding schemes. Rigorous comparison with three existing human-virus PPI prediction methods, our proposed computational framework further provided very competitive and promising performance, suggesting that the doc2vec encoding scheme effectively captures context information of protein sequences, pertaining to corresponding protein-protein interactions. Our approach is freely accessible through our web server as part of our host-pathogen PPI prediction platform (http://zzdlab.com/InterSPPI/). Taken together, we hope the current work not only contributes a useful predictor to accelerate the exploration of human-virus PPIs, but also provides some meaningful insights into human-virus relationships.},

Using machine-learning-based frameworks can not only automatically identify PPIs, but also provide new ideas for drug research and development from a promising alternative. We present a novel deep-forest-based method for PPIs prediction. Firstly, pseudo amino acid composition (PAAC), autocorrelation descriptor (Auto), multivariate mutual information (MMI), composition-transition-distribution (CTD), amino acid composition position-specific scoring matrix (AAC-PSSM), and dipeptide composition PSSM (DPC-PSSM) are adopted to extract and construct the pattern of PPIs. Secondly, elastic net is utilized to optimize the initial feature vectors and boost the predictive performance. Finally, we ensemble XGBoost, random forest, and extremely randomized trees to construct deep forest model via cascade architecture for PPIs prediction (GcForest-PPI). Benchmark experiments reveal that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art predictors on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Helicobacter pylori. We also apply GcForest-PPI on independent test sets, CD9-core network, crossover network, and cancer-specific network. The evaluation shows that GcForest-PPI can boost the prediction accuracy, complement experiments and improve drug discovery.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Graph embedding learning that aims to automatically learn low-dimensional node representations, has drawn increasing attention in recent years. To date, most recent graph embedding methods are evaluated on social and information networks and are not comprehensively studied on biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the other hand, for a variety of biomedical network analysis tasks, traditional techniques such as matrix factorization (which can be seen as a type of graph embedding methods) have shown promising results, and hence there is a need to systematically evaluate the more recent graph embedding methods (e.g. random walk-based and neural network-based) in terms of their usability and potential to further the state-of-the-art. RESULTS: We select 11 representative graph embedding methods and conduct a systematic comparison on 3 important biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease association (DDA) prediction, drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction; and 2 node classification tasks: medical term semantic type classification, protein function prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recent graph embedding methods achieve promising results and deserve more attention in the future biomedical graph analysis. Compared with three state-of-the-art methods for DDAs, DDIs and protein function predictions, the recent graph embedding methods achieve competitive performance without using any biological features and the learned embeddings can be treated as complementary representations for the biological features. By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for properly selecting graph embedding methods and setting their hyper-parameters for different biomedical tasks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: As part of our contributions in the paper, we develop an easy-to-use Python package with detailed instructions, BioNEV, available at: https://github.com/xiangyue9607/BioNEV, including all source code and datasets, to facilitate studying various graph embedding methods on biomedical tasks.
