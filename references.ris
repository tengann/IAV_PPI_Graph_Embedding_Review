AB  - Existing popular methods for semi-supervised learning with Graph Neural
      Networks (such as the Graph Convolutional Network) provably cannot learn a
      general class of neighborhood mixing relationships. To address this
      weakness, we propose a new model, MixHop, that can learn these
      relationships, including difference operators, by repeatedly mixing
      feature representations of neighbors at various distances. MixHop requires
      no additional memory or computational complexity, and outperforms on
      challenging baselines. In addition, we propose sparsity regularization
      that allows us to visualize how the network prioritizes neighborhood
      information across different graph datasets. Our analysis of the learned
      architectures reveals that neighborhood mixing varies per datasets.

TI  - PPIDomainMiner: Inferring domain-domain interactions from multiple sources
      of protein-protein interactions

AB  - Many biological processes are mediated by protein-protein interactions
      (PPIs). Because protein domains are the building blocks of proteins, PPIs
      likely rely on domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Several attempts exist
      to infer DDIs from PPI networks but the produced datasets are
      heterogeneous and sometimes not accessible, while the PPI interactome data
      keeps growing. We describe a new computational approach called "PPIDM"
      (Protein-Protein Interactions Domain Miner) for inferring DDIs using
      multiple sources of PPIs. The approach is an extension of our previously
      described "CODAC" (Computational Discovery of Direct Associations using
      Common neighbors) method for inferring new edges in a tripartite graph.
      The PPIDM method has been applied to seven widely used PPI resources,
      using as "Gold-Standard" a set of DDIs extracted from 3D structural
      databases. Overall, PPIDM has produced a dataset of 84,552 non-redundant
      DDIs. Statistical significance (p-value) is calculated for each source of
      PPI and used to classify the PPIDM DDIs in Gold (9,175 DDIs), Silver
      (24,934 DDIs) and Bronze (50,443 DDIs) categories. Dataset comparison
      reveals that PPIDM has inferred from the 2017 releases of PPI sources
      about 46% of the DDIs present in the 2020 release of the 3did database,
      not counting the DDIs present in the Gold-Standard. The PPIDM dataset
      contains 10,229 DDIs that are consistent with more than 13,300 PPIs
      extracted from the IMEx database, and nearly 23,300 DDIs (27.5%) that are
      consistent with more than 214,000 human PPIs extracted from the STRING
      database. Examples of newly inferred DDIs covering more than 10 PPIs in
      the IMEx database are provided. Further exploitation of the PPIDM DDI
      reservoir includes the inventory of possible partners of a protein of
      interest and characterization of protein interactions at the domain level
      in combination with other methods. The result is publicly available at
      http://ppidm.loria.fr/.

T2  - Database
VL  - 2016
SP  - baw103
PY  - 2016
DA  - 2016
AB  - Identification and analysis of host–pathogen interactions (HPI) is
      essential to study infectious diseases. However, HPI data are sparse in
      existing molecular interaction databases, especially for agricultural
      host–pathogen systems. Therefore, resources that annotate, predict and
      display the HPI that underpin infectious diseases are critical for
      developing novel intervention strategies. HPIDB 2.0 (
      http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/hpi/main.html ) is a resource for HPI data,
      and contains 45, 238 manually curated entries in the current release.
      Since the first description of the database in 2010, multiple enhancements
      to HPIDB data and interface services were made that are described here.
      Notably, HPIDB 2.0 now provides targeted biocuration of molecular
      interaction data. As a member of the International Molecular Exchange
      consortium, annotations provided by HPIDB 2.0 curators meet community
      standards to provide detailed contextual experimental information and
      facilitate data sharing. Moreover, HPIDB 2.0 provides access to rapidly
      available community annotations that capture minimum molecular interaction
      information to address immediate researcher needs for HPI network
      analysis. In addition to curation, HPIDB 2.0 integrates HPI from existing
      external sources and contains tools to infer additional HPI where
      annotated data are scarce. Compared to other interaction databases, our
      data collection approach ensures HPIDB 2.0 users access the most
      comprehensive HPI data from a wide range of pathogens and their hosts (594
      pathogen and 70 host species, as of February 2016). Improvements also
      include enhanced search capacity, addition of Gene Ontology functional
      information, and implementation of network visualization. The changes made
      to HPIDB 2.0 content and interface ensure that users, especially
      agricultural researchers, are able to easily access and analyse high
      quality, comprehensive HPI data. All HPIDB 2.0 data are updated regularly,
      are publically available for direct download, and are disseminated to
      other molecular interaction resources. Database

AB  - Development of new methods for analysis of protein–protein interactions
      (PPIs) at molecular and nanometer scales gives insights into intracellular
      signaling pathways and will improve understanding of protein functions, as
      well as other nanoscale structures of biological and abiological origins.
      Recent advances in computational tools, particularly the ones involving
      modern deep learning algorithms, have been shown to complement
      experimental approaches for describing and rationalizing PPIs. However,
      most of the existing works on PPI predictions use protein-sequence
      information, and thus have difficulties in accounting for the
      three-dimensional organization of the protein chains.

SP  - e6393
PY  - 2009
DA  - 2009
AB  - To reduce the increasing amount of time spent on literature search in the
      life sciences, several methods for automated knowledge extraction have
      been developed. Co-occurrence based approaches can deal with large text
      corpora like MEDLINE in an acceptable time but are not able to extract any
      specific type of semantic relation. Semantic relation extraction methods
      based on syntax trees, on the other hand, are computationally expensive
      and the interpretation of the generated trees is difficult. Several
      natural language processing (NLP) approaches for the biomedical domain
      exist focusing specifically on the detection of a limited set of relation
      types. For systems biology, generic approaches for the detection of a
      multitude of relation types which in addition are able to process large
      text corpora are needed but the number of systems meeting both
      requirements is very limited. We introduce the use of SENNA ("Semantic
      Extraction using a Neural Network Architecture"), a fast and accurate
      neural network based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) program, for the large
      scale extraction of semantic relations from the biomedical literature. A
      comparison of processing times of SENNA and other SRL systems or
      syntactical parsers used in the biomedical domain revealed that SENNA is
      the fastest Proposition Bank (PropBank) conforming SRL program currently
      available. 89 million biomedical sentences were tagged with SENNA on a 100
      node cluster within three days. The accuracy of the presented relation
      extraction approach was evaluated on two test sets of annotated sentences
      resulting in precision/recall values of 0.71/0.43. We show that the
      accuracy as well as processing speed of the proposed semantic relation
      extraction approach is sufficient for its large scale application on
      biomedical text. The proposed approach is highly generalizable regarding
      the supported relation types and appears to be especially suited for
      general-purpose, broad-scale text mining systems. The presented approach
      bridges the gap between fast, co-occurrence-based approaches lacking
      semantic relations and highly specialized and computationally demanding
      NLP approaches.

AB  - Knowledge about non-interacting proteins (NIPs) is important for training
      the algorithms to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and for
      assessing the false positive rates of PPI detection efforts. We present
      the second version of Negatome, a database of proteins and protein domains
      that are unlikely to engage in physical interactions (available online at
      http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/ppi/negatome). Negatome is derived
      by manual curation of literature and by analyzing three-dimensional
      structures of protein complexes. The main methodological innovation in
      Negatome 2.0 is the utilization of an advanced text mining procedure to
      guide the manual annotation process. Potential non-interactions were
      identified by a modified version of Excerbt, a text mining tool based on
      semantic sentence analysis. Manual verification shows that nearly a half
      of the text mining results with the highest confidence values correspond
      to NIP pairs. Compared to the first version the contents of the database
      have grown by over 300%.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Systematic dissection of the ubiquitylation proteome is
      emerging as an appealing but challenging research topic because of the
      significant roles ubiquitylation play not only in protein degradation but
      also in many other cellular functions. High-throughput experimental
      studies using mass spectrometry have identified many ubiquitylation sites,
      primarily from eukaryotes. However, the vast majority of ubiquitylation
      sites remain undiscovered, even in well-studied systems. Because mass
      spectrometry-based experimental approaches for identifying ubiquitylation
      events are costly, time-consuming and biased toward abundant proteins and
      proteotypic peptides, in silico prediction of ubiquitylation sites is a
      potentially useful alternative strategy for whole proteome annotation.
      Because of various limitations, current ubiquitylation site prediction
      tools were not well designed to comprehensively assess proteomes. RESULTS:
      We present a novel tool known as UbiProber, specifically designed for
      large-scale predictions of both general and species-specific
      ubiquitylation sites. We collected proteomics data for ubiquitylation from
      multiple species from several reliable sources and used them to train
      prediction models by a comprehensive machine-learning approach that
      integrates the information from key positions and key amino acid residues.
      Cross-validation tests reveal that UbiProber achieves some improvement
      over existing tools in predicting species-specific ubiquitylation sites.
      Moreover, independent tests show that UbiProber improves the areas under
      receiver operating characteristic curves by 15% by using the Combined
      model. AVAILABILITY: The UbiProber server is freely available on the web
      at http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/UbiProber.aspx. The software system of
      UbiProber can be downloaded at the same site. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

      data have been widely used to represent sequences and predict structural,
      functional, expression and interaction profiles of proteins and peptides
      as well as DNAs/RNAs. Here, we present iFeature, a versatile Python-based
      toolkit for generating various numerical feature representation schemes
      for both protein and peptide sequences. iFeature is capable of calculating
      and extracting a comprehensive spectrum of 18 major sequence encoding
      schemes that encompass 53 different types of feature descriptors. It also
      allows users to extract specific amino acid properties from the AAindex
      database. Furthermore, iFeature integrates 12 different types of commonly
      used feature clustering, selection and dimensionality reduction
      algorithms, greatly facilitating training, analysis and benchmarking of
      machine-learning models. The functionality of iFeature is made freely

AB  - As one of the most common post-translational modifications, ubiquitination
      regulates the quantity and function of a variety of proteins. Experimental
      and clinical investigations have also suggested the crucial roles of
      ubiquitination in several human diseases. The complicated sequence context
      of human ubiquitination sites revealed by proteomic studies highlights the
      need of developing effective computational strategies to predict human
      ubiquitination sites. Here we report the establishment of a novel
      human-specific ubiquitination site predictor through the integration of
      multiple complementary classifiers. Firstly, a Support Vector Machine
      (SVM) classier was constructed based on the composition of k-spaced amino
      acid pairs (CKSAAP) encoding, which has been utilized in our previous
      yeast ubiquitination site predictor. To further exploit the pattern and
      properties of the ubiquitination sites and their flanking residues, three
      additional SVM classifiers were constructed using the binary amino acid
      encoding, the AAindex physicochemical property encoding and the protein
      aggregation propensity encoding, respectively. Through an integration that
      relied on logistic regression, the resulting predictor termed
      hCKSAAP_UbSite achieved an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.770 in 5-fold
      cross-validation test on a class-balanced training dataset. When tested on
      a class-balanced independent testing dataset that contains 3419
      ubiquitination sites, hCKSAAP_UbSite has also achieved a robust
      performance with an AUC of 0.757. Specifically, it has consistently
      performed better than the predictor using the CKSAAP encoding alone and
      two other publicly available predictors which are not human-specific.
      Given its promising performance in our large-scale datasets,
      hCKSAAP_UbSite has been made publicly available at our server
      (http://protein.cau.edu.cn/cksaap_ubsite/).

AB  - How to incorporate the sequence order effect is a key and logical step for
      improving the prediction quality of protein subcellular location, but
      meanwhile it is a very difficult problem as well. This is because the
      number of possible sequence order patterns in proteins is extremely large,
      which has posed a formidable barrier to construct an effective training
      data set for statistical treatment based on the current knowledge. That is
      why most of the existing prediction algorithms are operated based on the
      amino-acid composition alone. In this paper, based on the physicochemical
      distance between amino acids, a set of sequence-order-coupling numbers was
      introduced to reflect the sequence order effect, or in a rigorous term,
      the quasi-sequence-order effect. Furthermore, the covariant discriminant
      algorithm by Chou and Elrod (Protein Eng. 12, 107-118, 1999) developed
      recently was augmented to allow the prediction performed by using the
      input of both the sequence-order-coupling numbers and amino-acid
      composition. A remarkable improvement was observed in the prediction
      quality using the augmented covariant discriminant algorithm. The approach
      described here represents one promising step forward in the efforts of
      incorporating sequence order effect in protein subcellular location
      prediction. It is anticipated that the current approach may also have a
      series of impacts on the prediction of other protein features by
      statistical approaches.

AB  - The cellular attributes of a protein, such as which compartment of a cell
      it belongs to and how it is associated with the lipid bilayer of an
      organelle, are closely correlated with its biological functions. The
      success of human genome project and the rapid increase in the number of
      protein sequences entering into data bank have stimulated a challenging
      frontier: How to develop a fast and accurate method to predict the
      cellular attributes of a protein based on its amino acid sequence? The
      existing algorithms for predicting these attributes were all based on the
      amino acid composition in which no sequence order effect was taken into
      account. To improve the prediction quality, it is necessary to incorporate
      such an effect. However, the number of possible patterns for protein
      sequences is extremely large, which has posed a formidable difficulty for
      realizing this goal. To deal with such a difficulty, the pseudo-amino acid
      composition is introduced. It is a combination of a set of discrete
      sequence correlation factors and the 20 components of the conventional
      amino acid composition. A remarkable improvement in prediction quality has
      been observed by using the pseudo-amino acid composition. The success
      rates of prediction thus obtained are so far the highest for the same
      classification schemes and same data sets. It has not escaped from our
      notice that the concept of pseudo-amino acid composition as well as its
      mathematical framework and biochemical implication may also have a notable
      impact on improving the prediction quality of other protein features.

AB  - MOTIVATION: With protein sequences entering into databanks at an explosive
      pace, the early determination of the family or subfamily class for a newly
      found enzyme molecule becomes important because this is directly related
      to the detailed information about which specific target it acts on, as
      well as to its catalytic process and biological function. Unfortunately,
      it is both time-consuming and costly to do so by experiments alone. In a
      previous study, the covariant-discriminant algorithm was introduced to
      identify the 16 subfamily classes of oxidoreductases. Although the results
      were quite encouraging, the entire prediction process was based on the
      amino acid composition alone without including any sequence-order
      information. Therefore, it is worthy of further investigation. RESULTS: To
      incorporate the sequence-order effects into the predictor, the
      'amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition' is introduced to represent the
      statistical sample of a protein. The novel representation contains 20 +
      2lambda discrete numbers: the first 20 numbers are the components of the
      conventional amino acid composition; the next 2lambda numbers are a set of
      correlation factors that reflect different hydrophobicity and
      hydrophilicity distribution patterns along a protein chain. Based on such
      a concept and formulation scheme, a new predictor is developed. It is
      shown by the self-consistency test, jackknife test and independent dataset
      tests that the success rates obtained by the new predictor are all
      significantly higher than those by the previous predictors. The
      significant enhancement in success rates also implies that the
      distribution of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the amino acid
      residues along a protein chain plays a very important role to its
      structure and function.

AB  - The localization of a protein in a cell is closely correlated with its
      biological function. With the explosion of protein sequences entering into
      DataBanks, it is highly desired to develop an automated method that can
      fast identify their subcellular location. This will expedite the
      annotation process, providing timely useful information for both basic
      research and industrial application. In view of this, a powerful predictor
      has been developed by hybridizing the gene ontology approach [Nat. Genet.
      25 (2000) 25], functional domain composition approach [J. Biol. Chem. 277
      (2002) 45765], and the pseudo-amino acid composition approach [Proteins
      Struct. Funct. Genet. 43 (2001) 246; Erratum: ibid. 44 (2001) 60]. As a
      showcase, the recently constructed dataset [Bioinformatics 19 (2003) 1656]
      was used for demonstration. The dataset contains 7589 proteins classified
      into 12 subcellular locations: chloroplast, cytoplasmic, cytoskeleton,
      endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular, Golgi apparatus, lysosomal,
      mitochondrial, nuclear, peroxisomal, plasma membrane, and vacuolar. The
      overall success rate of prediction obtained by the jackknife
      cross-validation was 92%. This is so far the highest success rate
      performed on this dataset by following an objective and rigorous
      cross-validation procedure.

AB  - The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely
      understood. Despite the importance suggested by many proteins variants
      statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have
      unknown mechanisms, for example, protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In
      this study, we address this challenge using a recent machine learning
      advance-deep neural networks (DNNs). We aim at improving the performance
      of PPIs prediction and propose a method called DeepPPI (Deep neural
      networks for Protein-Protein Interactions prediction), which employs deep
      neural networks to learn effectively the representations of proteins from
      common protein descriptors. The experimental results indicate that DeepPPI
      achieves superior performance on the test data set with an Accuracy of
      92.50%, Precision of 94.38%, Recall of 90.56%, Specificity of 94.49%,
      Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 85.08% and Area Under the Curve of
      97.43%, respectively. Extensive experiments show that DeepPPI can learn
      useful features of proteins pairs by a layer-wise abstraction, and thus
      achieves better prediction performance than existing methods. The source
      code of our approach can be available via

      descriptors was achieved by a computer-simulated neural network trained on
      a data base consisting of 83 folding classes. Protein-chain descriptors

      performed on 15 of the largest classes. The test shows that proteins were
      assigned to the correct class (correct positive prediction) with an
      average accuracy of 71.7%, whereas the inverse prediction of proteins as
      not belonging to a particular class (correct negative prediction) was
      90-95% accurate. When tested on 254 structures used in this study, the top
      two predictions contained the correct class in 91% of the cases.

      (SCOP). This method uses global descriptors of a primary protein sequence
      in terms of the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the

      descriptors in a way to discriminate members of a given fold from members
      of all other folds. An extensive testing of the method has been performed
      to evaluate its prediction accuracy. The method is applicable for the fold
      assignment of any protein sequence with or without significant sequence

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) perform various functions and regulate
      processes throughout cells. Knowledge of the full network of PPIs is vital
      to biomedical research, but most of the PPIs are still unknown. As it is
      infeasible to discover all of them experimentally due to technical and
      resource limitations, computational prediction of PPIs is essential and
      accurately assessing the performance of algorithms is required before
      further application or translation. However, many published methods
      compose their evaluation datasets incorrectly, using a higher proportion
      of positive class data than occuring naturally, leading to exaggerated
      performance. We re-implemented various published algorithms and evaluated
      them on datasets with realistic data compositions and found that their
      performance is overstated in original publications; with several methods
      outperformed by our control models built on 'illogical' and random number
      features. We conclude that these methods are influenced by an
      over-characterization of some proteins in the literature and due to
      scale-free nature of PPI network and that they fail when tested on all
      possible protein pairs. Additionally, we found that sequence-only-based
      algorithms performed worse than those that employ functional and
      expression features. We present a benchmark evaluation of many published
      algorithms for PPI prediction. The source code of our implementations and
      the benchmark datasets created here are made available in open source.

AB  - Motivation Can we predict protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of a novel
      virus with its host? Three major problems arise: the lack of known PPIs
      for that virus to learn from, the cost of learning about its proteins and
      the sequence dissimilarity among viral families that makes most methods
      inapplicable or inefficient. We develop DeNovo, a sequence-based negative
      sampling and machine learning framework that learns from PPIs of different
      viruses to predict for a novel one, exploiting the shared host proteins.
      We tested DeNovo on PPIs from different domains to assess
      generalization.Results: By solving the challenge of generating less noisy
      negative interactions, DeNovo achieved accuracy up to 81 and 86% when
      predicting PPIs of viral proteins that have no and distant sequence
      similarity to the ones used for training, receptively. This result is
      comparable to the best achieved in single virus-host and intra-species PPI
      prediction cases. Thus, we can now predict PPIs for virtually any virus
      infecting human. DeNovo generalizes well; it achieved near optimal
      accuracy when tested on bacteria–human interactions.Availability and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Representation learning provides new and powerful graph
      analytical approaches and tools for the highly valued data science
      challenge of mining knowledge graphs. Since previous graph analytical
      methods have mostly focused on homogeneous graphs, an important current
      challenge is extending this methodology for richly heterogeneous graphs
      and knowledge domains. The biomedical sciences are such a domain,
      reflecting the complexity of biology, with entities such as genes,
      proteins, drugs, diseases, and phenotypes, and relationships such as gene
      co-expression, biochemical regulation, and biomolecular inhibition or
      activation. Therefore, the semantics of edges and nodes are critical for
      representation learning and knowledge discovery in real world biomedical
      problems. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose the edge2vec model, which
      represents graphs considering edge semantics. An edge-type transition
      matrix is trained by an Expectation-Maximization approach, and a
      stochastic gradient descent model is employed to learn node embedding on a
      heterogeneous graph via the trained transition matrix. edge2vec is
      validated on three biomedical domain tasks: biomedical entity
      classification, compound-gene bioactivity prediction, and biomedical
      information retrieval. Results show that by considering edge-types into
      node embedding learning in heterogeneous graphs, edge2vec significantly
      outperforms state-of-the-art models on all three tasks. CONCLUSIONS: We
      propose this method for its added value relative to existing graph
      analytical methodology, and in the real world context of biomedical
      knowledge discovery applicability.

AB  - Experimentally determined networks are susceptible to errors, yet
      important inferences can still be drawn from them. Many real networks have
      also been shown to have the small-world network properties of cohesive
      neighborhoods and short average distances between vertices. Although much
      analysis has been done on small-world networks, small-world properties
      have not previously been used to improve our understanding of individual
      edges in experimentally derived graphs. Here we focus on a small-world
      network derived from high-throughput (and error-prone) protein-protein
      interaction experiments. We exploit the neighborhood cohesiveness property
      of small-world networks to assess confidence for individual
      protein-protein interactions. By ascertaining how well each
      protein-protein interaction (edge) fits the pattern of a small-world
      network, we stratify even those edges with identical experimental
      evidence. This result promises to improve the quality of inference from
      protein-protein interaction networks in particular and small-world
      networks in general.

AB  - Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort
      in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in
      the broader field of representation learning has led to significant
      progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves.
      However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to
      capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here
      we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous
      feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a
      mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the
      likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a
      flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased
      random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods.
      Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of
      network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in
      exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We
      demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art
      techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several
      real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work
      represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art
      task-independent representations in complex networks.

AB  - Motivation: High-throughput experimental techniques have produced a large
      amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, but their coverage is
      still low and the PPI data is also very noisy. Computational prediction of
      PPIs can be used to discover new PPIs and identify errors in the
      experimental PPI data. Results: We present a novel deep learning
      framework, DPPI, to model and predict PPIs from sequence information
      alone. Our model efficiently applies a deep, Siamese-like convolutional
      neural network combined with random projection and data augmentation to
      predict PPIs, leveraging existing high-quality experimental PPI data and
      evolutionary information of a protein pair under prediction. Our
      experimental results show that DPPI outperforms the state-of-the-art
      methods on several benchmarks in terms of area under precision-recall
      curve (auPR), and computationally is more efficient. We also show that
      DPPI is able to predict homodimeric interactions where other methods fail
      to work accurately, and the effectiveness of DPPI in specific applications
      such as predicting cytokine-receptor binding affinities. Availability and

AB  - Molecular interaction networks are powerful resources for molecular
      discovery. They are increasingly used with machine learning methods to
      predict biologically meaningful interactions. While deep learning on
      graphs has dramatically advanced the prediction prowess, current graph
      neural network (GNN) methods are mainly optimized for prediction on the
      basis of direct similarity between interacting nodes. In biological
      networks, however, similarity between nodes that do not directly interact
      has proved incredibly useful in the last decade across a variety of
      interaction networks. Here, we present SkipGNN, a graph neural network
      approach for the prediction of molecular interactions. SkipGNN predicts
      molecular interactions by not only aggregating information from direct
      interactions but also from second-order interactions, which we call skip
      similarity. In contrast to existing GNNs, SkipGNN receives neural messages
      from two-hop neighbors as well as immediate neighbors in the interaction
      network and non-linearly transforms the messages to obtain useful
      information for prediction. To inject skip similarity into a GNN, we
      construct a modified version of the original network, called the skip
      graph. We then develop an iterative fusion scheme that optimizes a GNN
      using both the skip graph and the original graph. Experiments on four
      interaction networks, including drug-drug, drug-target, protein-protein,
      and gene-disease interactions, show that SkipGNN achieves superior and
      robust performance. Furthermore, we show that unlike popular GNNs, SkipGNN
      learns biologically meaningful embeddings and performs especially well on
      noisy, incomplete interaction networks.

AB  - Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause annual epidemics and occasional pandemics
      in the human population. IAVs are subtyped according to the viral envelope
      glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. IAVs,
      seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 as well as some other subtypes cause respiratory
      tract infections that can occasionally be severe leading to pneumonia or
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans. IAV infections can
      be prevented with vaccines or treated with antiviral drugs. However, the
      vaccine composition needs to be updated every year due to antigenic
      variation of IAVs.

AB  - The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most
      algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or
      some variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the
      Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dynamic time
      warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series,
      allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time
      axis. Because of this flexibility, DTW is widely used in science,
      medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey
      the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact
      indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing
      techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding
      up sequential searches. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for
      the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false
      dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing
      approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series
      indexing experiments ever undertaken.

AB  - Despite exceptional experimental efforts to map out the human interactome,
      the continued data incompleteness limits our ability to understand the
      molecular roots of human disease. Computational tools offer a promising
      alternative, helping identify biologically significant, yet unmapped
      protein-protein interactions (PPIs). While link prediction methods connect
      proteins on the basis of biological or network-based similarity,
      interacting proteins are not necessarily similar and similar proteins do
      not necessarily interact. Here, we offer structural and evolutionary
      evidence that proteins interact not if they are similar to each other, but
      if one of them is similar to the other’s partners. This approach, that
      mathematically relies on network paths of length three (L3), significantly
      outperforms all existing link prediction methods. Given its high accuracy,
      we show that L3 can offer mechanistic insights into disease mechanisms and
      can complement future experimental efforts to complete the human
      interactome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are of great importance in
      cellular systems of organisms, since they are the basis of cellular
      structure and function and many essential cellular processes are related
      to that. Most proteins perform their functions by interacting with other
      proteins, so predicting PPIs accurately is crucial for understanding cell
      physiology. RESULTS: Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have
      been proposed to capture the graph structure information and generate
      representations for nodes in the graph. In our paper, we use GCNs to learn
      the position information of proteins in the PPIs networks graph, which can
      reflect the properties of proteins to some extent. Combining amino acid
      sequence information and position information makes a stronger
      representation for protein, which improves the accuracy of PPIs
      prediction. CONCLUSION: In previous research methods, most of them only
      used protein amino acid sequence as input information to make predictions,
      without considering the structural information of PPIs networks graph. We
      first time combine amino acid sequence information and position
      information to make representations for proteins. The experimental results
      indicate that our method has strong competitiveness compared with several
      sequence-based methods.

      Node2vec is the most widely used method for node embedding. However, its
      original Python and C++ implementations scale poorly with network density,
      failing for dense biological networks with hundreds of millions of edges.
      We have developed PecanPy, a new Python implementation of node2vec that

AB  - Dealing with relational data always required significant computational
      resources, domain expertise and task-dependent feature engineering to
      incorporate structural information into a predictive model. Nowadays, a
      family of automated graph feature engineering techniques has been proposed
      in different streams of literature. So-called graph embeddings provide a
      powerful tool to construct vectorized feature spaces for graphs and their
      components, such as nodes, edges and subgraphs under preserving inner
      graph properties. Using the constructed feature spaces, many machine
      learning problems on graphs can be solved via standard frameworks suitable
      for vectorized feature representation. Our survey aims to describe the
      core concepts of graph embeddings and provide several taxonomies for their
      description. First, we start with the methodological approach and extract
      three types of graph embedding models based on matrix factorization,
      random-walks and deep learning approaches. Next, we describe how different
      types of networks impact the ability of models to incorporate structural
      and attributed data into a unified embedding. Going further, we perform a
      thorough evaluation of graph embedding applications to machine learning
      problems on graphs, among which are node classification, link prediction,
      clustering, visualization, compression, and a family of the whole graph
      embedding algorithms suitable for graph classification, similarity and
      alignment problems. Finally, we overview the existing applications of
      graph embeddings to computer science domains, formulate open problems and
      provide experiment results, explaining how different networks properties
      result in graph embeddings quality in the four classic machine learning
      problems on graphs, such as node classification, link prediction,
      clustering and graph visualization. As a result, our survey covers a new
      rapidly growing field of network feature engineering, presents an in-depth
      analysis of models based on network types, and overviews a wide range of
      applications to machine learning problems on graphs.

AB  - Over the last two decades, network theory has shown to be a fruitful
      paradigm in understanding the organization and functioning of real-world
      complex systems. One technique helpful to this endeavor is identifying
      functionally influential subgraphs, shedding light on underlying
      evolutionary processes. Such overrepresented subgraphs, motifs, have
      received much attention in simple networks, where edges are either on or
      off. However, for weighted networks, motif analysis is still undeveloped.
      Here, we proposed a novel methodology—based on a random walker taking a
      fixed maximum number of steps—to study weighted motifs of limited size. We
      introduce a sink node to balance the network and allow the detection of
      configurations within an a priori fixed number of steps for the random
      walker. We applied this approach to different real networks and selected a
      specific null model based on maximum-entropy to test the significance of
      weighted motifs occurrence. We found that identified similarities enable
      the classifications of systems according to functioning mechanisms
      associated with specific configurations: economic networks exhibit close
      patterns while differentiating from ecological systems without any a
      priori assumption.

AB  - Representation learning on networks offers a powerful alternative to the
      oft painstaking process of manual feature engineering, and, as a result,
      has enjoyed considerable success in recent years. However, all the
      existing representation learning methods are based on the first-order
      network, that is, the network that only captures the pairwise interactions
      between the nodes. As a result, these methods may fail to incorporate
      non-Markovian higher order dependencies in the network. Thus, the
      embeddings that are generated may not accurately represent the underlying
      phenomena in a network, resulting in inferior performance in different
      inductive or transductive learning tasks. To address this challenge, this
      study presents higher order network embedding (HONEM), a higher order
      network (HON) embedding method that captures the non-Markovian higher
      order dependencies in a network. HONEM is specifically designed for the
      HON structure and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in node
      classification, network reconstruction, link prediction, and visualization
      for networks that contain non-Markovian higher order dependencies.

AB  - Proteins embody epitopes that serve as their antigenic determinants.
      Epitopes occupy a central place in integrative biology, not to mention as
      targets for novel vaccine, pharmaceutical, and systems diagnostics
      development. The presence of T-cell and B-cell epitopes has been
      extensively studied due to their potential in synthetic vaccine design.
      However, reliable prediction of linear B-cell epitope remains a formidable
      challenge. Earlier studies have reported discrepancy in amino acid
      composition between the epitopes and non-epitopes. Hence, this study
      proposed and developed a novel amino acid composition-based feature
      descriptor, Dipeptide Deviation from Expected Mean (DDE), to distinguish
      the linear B-cell epitopes from non-epitopes effectively. In this study,
      for the first time, only exact linear B-cell epitopes and non-epitopes
      have been utilized for developing the prediction method, unlike the use of
      epitope-containing regions in earlier reports. To evaluate the performance
      of the DDE feature vector, models have been developed with two widely used
      machine-learning techniques Support Vector Machine and AdaBoost-Random
      Forest. Five-fold cross-validation performance of the proposed method with
      error-free dataset and dataset from other studies achieved an overall
      accuracy between nearly 61% and 73%, with balance between sensitivity and
      specificity metrics. Performance of the DDE feature vector was better
      (with accuracy difference of about 2% to 12%), in comparison to other
      amino acid-derived features on different datasets. This study reflects the
      efficiency of the DDE feature vector in enhancing the linear B-cell
      epitope prediction performance, compared to other feature representations.
      The proposed method is made as a stand-alone tool available freely for
      researchers, particularly for those interested in vaccine design and novel
      molecular target development for systems therapeutics and diagnostics:

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important for the study of protein
      functions and pathways involved in different biological processes, as well
      as for understanding the cause and progression of diseases. Several
      high-throughput experimental techniques have been employed for the
      identification of PPIs in a few model organisms, but still, there is a
      huge gap in identifying all possible binary PPIs in an organism.
      Therefore, PPI prediction using machine-learning algorithms has been used
      in conjunction with experimental methods for discovery of novel protein
      interactions. The two most popular supervised machine-learning techniques
      used in the prediction of PPIs are support vector machines and random
      forest classifiers. Bayesian-probabilistic inference has also been used
      but mainly for the scoring of high-throughput PPI dataset confidence
      measures. Recently, deep-learning algorithms have been used for
      sequence-based prediction of PPIs. Several clustering methods such as
      hierarchical and k-means are useful as unsupervised machine-learning
      algorithms for the prediction of interacting protein pairs without
      explicit data labelling. In summary, machine-learning techniques have been
      widely used for the prediction of PPIs thus allowing experimental
      researchers to study cellular PPI networks.

AB  - A method for the rational design of locally encoded amino acid sequence
      features using artificial neural networks and a technique for simulating
      molecular evolution has been developed. De novo in machine design of
      Escherichia coli leader peptidase (SP1) cleavage sites serves as an
      example application. A modular neural network system that employs sequence
      descriptions in terms of physicochemical properties has been trained on
      the recognition of characteristic cleavage site features. It is used for
      sequence qualification in the design cycle, representing the sequence
      fitness function. Starting from a random sequence several cleavage site
      sequences were generated by a simulated molecular evolution technique. It
      is based on a simple genetic algorithm that takes the quality values
      calculated by the artificial neural network as a heuristic for inductive
      sequence optimization. Simulated in vivo mutation and selection allows the
      identification of predominant sequence positions in Escherichia coli
      signal peptide cleavage site regions (positions -2 and -6). Various amino
      acid distance maps are used to define metrics for the step size of
      mutations. Position-specific mutability values indicate sequence positions
      exposed to high or low selection pressure in the simulations. The use of
      several distance maps leads to different courses of optimization and to
      various idealized sequences. It is concluded that amino acid distances are
      context dependent. Furthermore, a method for identification of local
      optima during sequence optimization is presented.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to most biological
      processes. Although efforts have been devoted to the development of
      methodology for predicting PPIs and protein interaction networks, the
      application of most existing methods is limited because they need
      information about protein homology or the interaction marks of the protein
      partners. In the present work, we propose a method for PPI prediction
      using only the information of protein sequences. This method was developed
      based on a learning algorithm-support vector machine combined with a
      kernel function and a conjoint triad feature for describing amino acids.
      More than 16,000 diverse PPI pairs were used to construct the universal
      model. The prediction ability of our approach is better than that of other
      sequence-based PPI prediction methods because it is able to predict PPI
      networks. Different types of PPI networks have been effectively mapped
      with our method, suggesting that, even with only sequence information,
      this method could be applied to the exploration of networks for any newly
      discovered protein with unknown biological relativity. In addition, such
      supplementary experimental information can enhance the prediction ability
      of the method.

AB  - Computational methods to predict protein–protein interaction (PPI)
      typically segregate into sequence-based ‘bottom-up’ methods that infer
      properties from the characteristics of the individual protein sequences,
      or global ‘top-down’ methods that infer properties from the pattern of
      already known PPIs in the species of interest. However, a way to
      incorporate top-down insights into sequence-based bottom-up PPI prediction
      methods has been elusive. We thus introduce Topsy-Turvy, a method that
      newly synthesizes both views in a sequence-based, multi-scale,
      deep-learning model for PPI prediction. While Topsy-Turvy makes
      predictions using only sequence data, during the training phase it takes a
      transfer-learning approach by incorporating patterns from both global and
      molecular-level views of protein interaction. In a cross-species context,
      we show it achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering the ability to
      perform genome-scale, interpretable PPI prediction for non-model organisms
      with no existing experimental PPI data. In species with available
      experimental PPI data, we further present a Topsy-Turvy hybrid (TT-Hybrid)
      model which integrates Topsy-Turvy with a purely network-based model for
      link prediction that provides information about species-specific network
      rewiring. TT-Hybrid makes accurate predictions for both well- and
      sparsely-characterized proteins, outperforming both its constituent
      components as well as other state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods.
      Furthermore, running Topsy-Turvy and TT-Hybrid screens is feasible for
      whole genomes, and thus these methods scale to settings where other
      methods (e.g. AlphaFold-Multimer) might be infeasible. The
      generalizability, accuracy and genome-level scalability of Topsy-Turvy and
      TT-Hybrid unlocks a more comprehensive map of protein interaction and
      organization in both model and non-model
      organisms.https://topsyturvy.csail.mit.edu.Supplementary data are

AB  - Spatial autocorrelation (SA) methods were recently extended to detect
      local spatial autocorrelation (LSA) at individual localities. LSA
      statistics serve as useful indicators of local genetic population
      structure. We applied this method to 15 allele frequencies from 43
      villages of a South American tribe, the Yanomama. Based on a network of
      links <or=51 km between neighboring villages, we calculated LSA statistics
      for Moran, Geary, and Getis-Ord coefficients. We also developed two new,
      rescaled indices of local SA. Local indicators of positive SA highlight
      villages surrounded by genetically similar near neighbors. Negative LSA
      statistics indicate sharp genetic differences from near neighbors.
      Markedly positive LSA was found for all 11 outlier villages. The most
      negatively LSA villages are in the central, densely connected cluster. The
      Getis-Ord coefficients of suitably transformed allele frequencies point to
      clusters of villages with unusually high or low allelic polymorphisms. The
      most homozygous villages are all in the four geographically isolated
      village clusters. The most polymorphic villages are all in the large,
      densely settled Yanomame dialect group. An ad hoc linguistic isolation
      index between neighboring villages showed that villages in isolated pairs
      and triplets have linguistically similar neighbors, whereas nine villages
      with notably negative LSA are all near dialect and kinship boundaries. The
      location of a village with respect to the graph structure of its
      neighborhood affects its LSA and genetic polymorphism. The implications of
      these findings for the population structure of the Yanomama are compatible
      with those from an earlier study of global SA in these villages.

AB  - Most proteins perform their biological function by interacting with
      themselves or other molecules. Thus, one may obtain biological insights
      into protein functions, disease prevalence, and therapy development by
      identifying protein-protein interactions (PPI). However, finding the
      interacting and non-interacting protein pairs through experimental
      approaches is labour-intensive and time-consuming, owing to the variety of
      proteins. Hence, protein-protein interaction and protein-ligand binding
      problems have drawn attention in the fields of bioinformatics and
      computer-aided drug discovery. Deep learning methods paved the way for
      scientists to predict the 3-D structure of proteins from genomes, predict
      the functions and attributes of a protein, and modify and design new
      proteins to provide desired functions. This review focuses on recent deep
      learning methods applied to problems including predicting protein
      functions, protein-protein interaction and their sites, protein-ligand
      binding, and protein design.

AB  - Genes and proteins are organized on the basis of their particular mutual
      relations or according to their interactions in cellular and genetic
      networks. These include metabolic or signaling pathways and protein
      interaction, regulatory or co-expression networks. Integrating the
      information from the different types of networks may lead to the notion of
      a functional network and functional modules. To find these modules, we
      propose a new technique which is based on collective, multi-body
      correlations in a genetic network. We calculated the correlation strength
      of a group of genes (e.g. in the co-expression network) which were
      identified as members of a module in a different network (e.g. in the
      protein interaction network) and estimated the probability that this
      correlation strength was found by chance. Groups of genes with a
      significant correlation strength in different networks have a high
      probability that they perform the same function. Here, we propose
      evaluating the multi-body correlations by applying the superparamagnetic
      approach. We compare our method to the presently applied mean Pearson
      correlations and show that our method is more sensitive in revealing
      functional relationships.

AB  - Viral infections represent a major health concern worldwide. The alarming
      rate at which SARS-CoV-2 spreads, for example, led to a worldwide
      pandemic. Viruses incorporate genetic material into the host genome to
      hijack host cell functions such as the cell cycle and apoptosis. In these
      viral processes, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play critical roles.
      Therefore, the identification of PPIs between humans and viruses is
      crucial for understanding the infection mechanism and host immune
      responses to viral infections and for discovering effective drugs.
      Experimental methods including mass spectrometry-based proteomics and
      yeast two-hybrid assays are widely used to identify human-virus PPIs, but
      these experimental methods are time-consuming, expensive, and laborious.
      To overcome this problem, we developed a novel computational predictor,
      named cross-attention PHV, by implementing two key technologies of the
      cross-attention mechanism and a one-dimensional convolutional neural
      network (1D-CNN). The cross-attention mechanisms were very effective in
      enhancing prediction and generalization abilities. Application of 1D-CNN
      to the word2vec-generated feature matrices reduced computational costs,
      thus extending the allowable length of protein sequences to 9000 amino
      acid residues. Cross-attention PHV outperformed existing state-of-the-art
      models using a benchmark dataset and accurately predicted PPIs for unknown
      viruses. Cross-attention PHV also predicted human-SARS-CoV-2 PPIs with
      area under the curve values >0.95. The Cross-attention PHV web server and
      source codes are freely available at
      https://kurata35.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/Cross-attention_PHV/ and

AB  - There are many weighted graphs in the real-world networks, such as social
      networks, communication networks, citation networks, etc. Along with
      successful application of deep learning in graph embedding, we study how
      to embed weight graph, because weights on the edges also play an important
      role in the graph. We propose a novel algorithm called ProbWalk, which
      take advantage of edge weights and convert the weights into transition
      probabilities. Our proposed method specifies the strategy of sampling the
      surrounding vertices by weights and generate the random walk for graph
      embedding according to transition probability. We evaluate our methods on
      tasks including multi-label classification and link prediction.
      Experimental results show that our method performs better than competed
      method on several weighted graph datasets.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for most biological
      processes. However, current PPI networks present high levels of noise,
      sparseness and incompleteness, which limits our ability to understand the
      cell at the system level from the PPI network. Predicting novel (missing)
      links in noisy PPI networks is an essential computational method for
      automatically expanding the human interactome and for identifying
      biologically legitimate but undetected interactions for experimental
      determination of PPIs, which is both expensive and time-consuming.
      Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCN) have shown their
      effectiveness in modeling graph-structured data, which employ a 1-hop
      neighborhood aggregation procedure and have emerged as a powerful
      architecture for node or graph representations. In this paper, we propose
      a novel node (protein) embedding method by combining GCN and PageRank as
      the latter can significantly improve the GCN's aggregation scheme, which
      has difficulty in extending and exploring topological information of
      networks across higher-order neighborhoods of each node. Building on this
      novel node embedding model, we develop a higher-order GCN variational
      auto-encoder (HO-VGAE) architecture, which can learn a joint node
      representation of higher-order local and global PPI network topology for
      novel protein interaction prediction. It is worth noting that our method
      is based exclusively on network topology, with no protein attributes or
      extra biological features used. Extensive computational validations on PPI
      prediction task demonstrate our method without leveraging any additional
      biological information shows competitive performance-outperforms all
      existing graph embedding-based link prediction methods in both accuracy
      and robustness.

AB  - Many Network Representation Learning (NRL) methods have been proposed to
      learn vector representations for vertices in a network recently. In this
      paper, we summarize most existing NRL methods into a unified two-step
      framework, including proximity matrix construction and dimension
      reduction. We focus on the analysis of proximity matrix construction step
      and conclude that an NRL method can be improved by exploring higher order
      proximities when building the proximity matrix. We propose Network
      Embedding Update (NEU) algorithm which implicitly approximates higher
      order proximities with theoretical approximation bound and can be applied
      on any NRL methods to enhance their performances. We conduct experiments
      on multi-label classification and link prediction tasks. Experimental
      results show that NEU can make a consistent and significant improvement
      over a number of NRL methods with almost negligible running time on all
      three publicly available datasets. The source code of this paper can be
      obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/NEU.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to many
      biological processes. Considering that the experimental methods for
      identifying PPIs are time-consuming and expensive, it is important to
      develop automated computational methods to better predict PPIs. Various
      machine learning methods have been proposed, including a deep learning
      technique which is sequence-based that has achieved promising results.
      However, it only focuses on sequence information while ignoring the
      structural information of PPI networks. Structural information of PPI
      networks such as their degree, position, and neighboring nodes in a graph
      has been proved to be informative in PPI prediction. RESULTS: Facing the
      challenge of representing graph information, we introduce an improved
      graph representation learning method. Our model can study PPI prediction
      based on both sequence information and graph structure. Moreover, our
      study takes advantage of a representation learning model and employs a
      graph-based deep learning method for PPI prediction, which shows
      superiority over existing sequence-based methods. Statistically, Our
      method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.15% on Human protein
      reference database (HPRD) dataset and also obtains best results on
      Database of Interacting Protein (DIP) Human, Drosophila, Escherichia coli
      (E. coli), and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegan) datasets. CONCLUSION:
      Here, we introduce signed variational graph auto-encoder (S-VGAE), an
      improved graph representation learning method, to automatically learn to
      encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings. Experimental
      results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing
      sequence-based methods on several datasets. We also prove the robustness
      of our model for very sparse networks and the generalization for a new
      dataset that consists of four datasets: HPRD, E.coli, C.elegan, and
      Drosophila.

AB  - The identification of human-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
      an essential and challenging research topic, potentially providing a
      mechanistic understanding of viral infection. Given that the experimental
      determination of human-virus PPIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive,
      computational methods are playing an important role in providing testable
      hypotheses, complementing the determination of large-scale interactome
      between species. In this work, we applied an unsupervised sequence
      embedding technique (doc2vec) to represent protein sequences as rich
      feature vectors of low dimensionality. Training a Random Forest (RF)
      classifier through a training dataset that covers known PPIs between human
      and all viruses, we obtained excellent predictive accuracy outperforming
      various combinations of machine learning algorithms and commonly-used
      sequence encoding schemes. Rigorous comparison with three existing
      human-virus PPI prediction methods, our proposed computational framework
      further provided very competitive and promising performance, suggesting
      that the doc2vec encoding scheme effectively captures context information
      of protein sequences, pertaining to corresponding protein-protein
      interactions. Our approach is freely accessible through our web server as
      part of our host-pathogen PPI prediction platform
      (http://zzdlab.com/InterSPPI/). Taken together, we hope the current work
      not only contributes a useful predictor to accelerate the exploration of
      human-virus PPIs, but also provides some meaningful insights into
      human-virus relationships.

AB  - Prediction of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) helps to grasp molecular
      roots of disease. However, web-lab experiments to predict PPIs are limited
      and costly. Using machine-learning-based frameworks can not only
      automatically identify PPIs, but also provide new ideas for drug research
      and development from a promising alternative. We present a novel
      deep-forest-based method for PPIs prediction. Firstly, pseudo amino acid
      composition (PAAC), autocorrelation descriptor (Auto), multivariate mutual
      information (MMI), composition-transition-distribution (CTD), amino acid
      composition position-specific scoring matrix (AAC-PSSM), and dipeptide
      composition PSSM (DPC-PSSM) are adopted to extract and construct the
      pattern of PPIs. Secondly, elastic net is utilized to optimize the initial
      feature vectors and boost the predictive performance. Finally, we ensemble
      XGBoost, random forest, and extremely randomized trees to construct deep
      forest model via cascade architecture for PPIs prediction (GcForest-PPI).
      Benchmark experiments reveal that the proposed approach outperforms other
      state-of-the-art predictors on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Helicobacter
      pylori. We also apply GcForest-PPI on independent test sets, CD9-core
      network, crossover network, and cancer-specific network. The evaluation
      shows that GcForest-PPI can boost the prediction accuracy, complement
      experiments and improve drug discovery.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Graph embedding learning that aims to automatically learn
      low-dimensional node representations, has drawn increasing attention in
      recent years. To date, most recent graph embedding methods are evaluated
      on social and information networks and are not comprehensively studied on
      biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the
      other hand, for a variety of biomedical network analysis tasks,
      traditional techniques such as matrix factorization (which can be seen as
      a type of graph embedding methods) have shown promising results, and hence
      there is a need to systematically evaluate the more recent graph embedding
      methods (e.g. random walk-based and neural network-based) in terms of
      their usability and potential to further the state-of-the-art. RESULTS: We
      select 11 representative graph embedding methods and conduct a systematic
      comparison on 3 important biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease
      association (DDA) prediction, drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction,
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction; and 2 node classification
      tasks: medical term semantic type classification, protein function
      prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recent graph
      embedding methods achieve promising results and deserve more attention in
      the future biomedical graph analysis. Compared with three state-of-the-art
      methods for DDAs, DDIs and protein function predictions, the recent graph
      embedding methods achieve competitive performance without using any
      biological features and the learned embeddings can be treated as
      complementary representations for the biological features. By summarizing
      the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for properly
      selecting graph embedding methods and setting their hyper-parameters for
      different biomedical tasks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: As part of
      our contributions in the paper, we develop an easy-to-use Python package
      with detailed instructions, BioNEV, available at:
      https://github.com/xiangyue9607/BioNEV, including all source code and
      datasets, to facilitate studying various graph embedding methods on
      biomedical tasks. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are
      available at Bioinformatics online.
